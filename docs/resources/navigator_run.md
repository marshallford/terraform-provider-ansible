# ansible_navigator_run (Resource)

Run an Ansible playbook. Requires `ansible-navigator` and a container engine to run within an execution environment (EE).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# 1. inline playbook and inventory
resource "ansible_navigator_run" "inline" {
  playbook = <<-EOT
  - hosts: webservers
    tasks:
    - ansible.builtin.package:
        name: nginx
  EOT
  inventory = yamlencode({
    webservers = {
      hosts = {
        a = { ansible_host = "webserver-a.example.com" }
      }
    }
  })
}

# 2. existing playbook and inventory
resource "ansible_navigator_run" "existing" {
  playbook  = file("playbook.yaml")
  inventory = file("inventory/baremetal.yaml")
}

# 3. configure ansible with ansible.cfg placed in working directory (see example below)
resource "ansible_navigator_run" "working_directory" {
  playbook          = "# example"
  inventory         = yamlencode({})
  working_directory = "some-directory-with-ansible-cfg-file"
}

# 4. set and pass environment variables
resource "ansible_navigator_run" "environment_variables" {
  playbook  = <<-EOT
  - hosts: all
    tasks:
    - ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ item }}"
      loop:
      - "{{ lookup('ansible.builtin.env', 'SOME_VAR') }}"
      - "{{ lookup('ansible.builtin.env', 'EDITOR') }}"
  EOT
  inventory = yamlencode({})
  execution_environment = {
    environment_variables_set = {
      "SOME_VAR" = "some-value"
    }
    environment_variables_pass = [
      "EDITOR",
    ]
  }
}

# 5. ansible playbook options
resource "ansible_navigator_run" "ansible_options" {
  playbook  = "# example"
  inventory = yamlencode({})
  ansible_options = {
    force_handlers = true               # --force-handlers
    skip_tags      = ["tag1", "tag2"]   # --skip-tags tag1,tag2
    start_at_task  = "task name"        # --start-at-task task name
    limit          = ["host1", "host2"] # --limit host1,host2
    tags           = ["tag3", "tag4"]   # --tags tag3,tag4
  }
}

# 6. run on destroy
resource "ansible_navigator_run" "destroy" {
  playbook       = <<-EOT
  - hosts: all
    tasks:
    - ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        destroy: "{{ lookup('ansible.builtin.env', 'ANSIBLE_TF_OPERATION') == 'delete' }}"
    - ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "resource is being destroyed!"
      when: destroy
  EOT
  inventory      = yamlencode({})
  run_on_destroy = true
}

# 7. triggers and replacement triggers
resource "ansible_navigator_run" "triggers" {
  playbook  = "# example"
  inventory = yamlencode({})
  triggers = {
    somekey = some_resource.example.id # re-run playbook when id changes
  }
  replacement_triggers = {
    somekey = some_resource.example.id # recreate resource when id changes
  }
}

# 8. artifact queries -- get playbook stdout
resource "ansible_navigator_run" "artifact_query_stdout" {
  playbook  = "# example"
  inventory = yamlencode({})
  artifact_queries = {
    "stdout" = {
      jq_filter = ".stdout"
    }
  }
}

output "playbook_stdout" {
  value = join("\n", jsondecode(ansible_navigator_run.artifact_query_stdout.artifact_queries.stdout.results[0]))
}

# 9. ssh private keys
resource "tls_private_key" "client" {
  algorithm = "ED25519"
}

resource "ansible_navigator_run" "private_keys" {
  playbook  = "# example"
  inventory = yamlencode({})
  ansible_options = {
    private_keys = [
      {
        name = "example"
        data = tls_private_key.client.private_key_openssh
      }
    ]
  }
}

# 10. ssh known hosts
resource "tls_private_key" "server" {
  algorithm = "ED25519"
}

resource "ansible_navigator_run" "known_hosts" {
  playbook = "# example"
  inventory = yamlencode({
    all = {
      vars = {
        ansible_ssh_common_args = "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=yes -o UserKnownHostsFile={{ ansible_ssh_known_hosts_file }}"
      }
    }
  })
  ansible_options = {
    known_hosts = [
      "10.0.0.1 ${tls_private_key.server.public_key_openssh}"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `inventory` (String) Ansible [inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/get_started_inventory.html) contents.

### Optional

- `ansible_navigator_binary` (String) Path to the `ansible-navigator` binary. By default `$PATH` is searched.
- `ansible_options` (Attributes) Ansible [playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html) run related configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ansible_options))
- `artifact_queries` (Attributes Map) Query the Ansible playbook artifact with [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) syntax. The [playbook artifact](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.0-ea/html/ansible_navigator_creator_guide/assembly-troubleshooting-navigator_ansible-navigator#proc-review-artifact_troubleshooting-navigator) contains detailed information about every play and task, as well as the stdout from the playbook run. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--artifact_queries))
- `execution_environment` (Attributes) [Execution environment](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started_ee/index.html) (EE) related configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--execution_environment))
- `replacement_triggers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will recreate the resource. Similar to `triggers`, but will cause `id` to change. Useful when combined with `run_on_destroy`.
- `run_on_destroy` (Boolean) Run playbook on destroy. The environment variable `ANSIBLE_TF_OPERATION` is set to `delete` during the run to allow for conditional plays, tasks, etc. Defaults to `false`.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `timezone` (String) IANA time zone, use `local` for the system time zone. Defaults to `UTC`.
- `triggers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will run the playbook again. Serves as alternative way to trigger a run without changing the inventory or playbook.
- `working_directory` (String) Directory which `ansible-navigator` is run from. Recommended to be the root Ansible [content directory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/tips_tricks/sample_setup.html#sample-directory-layout) (sometimes called the project directory), which is likely to contain `ansible.cfg`, `roles/`, etc. Defaults to `.`.

### Read-Only

- `command` (String) Generated `ansible-navigator` run command. Useful for troubleshooting.
- `id` (String) UUID.

<a id="nestedatt--ansible_options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `ansible_options`

Optional:

- `force_handlers` (Boolean) Run handlers even if a task fails.
- `known_hosts` (List of String) SSH known host entries. Can help protect against man-in-the-middle attacks by verifying the identity of hosts. Ansible variable `ansible_ssh_known_hosts_file` set to path of `known_hosts` file. If unspecified will be set to contents of `known_hosts` file after run.
- `limit` (List of String) Further limit selected hosts to an additional pattern.
- `private_keys` (Attributes List) SSH private keys used for authentication in addition to the [automatically mounted](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/faq/#how-do-i-use-my-ssh-keys-with-an-execution-environment) default named keys and SSH agent socket path. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ansible_options--private_keys))
- `skip_tags` (List of String) Only run plays and tasks whose tags do not match these values.
- `start_at_task` (String) Start the playbook at the task matching this name.
