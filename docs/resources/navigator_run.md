# ansible_navigator_run (Resource)

Run an Ansible playbook within an execution environment (EE). Requires `ansible-navigator` and a container engine to run the EE.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# inline playbook and inventory
resource "ansible_navigator_run" "inline" {
  working_directory = "/some/dir"
  playbook          = <<-EOT
  - hosts: some_group

        hosts:

## Schema

### Required

- `inventory` (String) Ansible [inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/get_started_inventory.html) contents.
- `playbook` (String) Ansible [playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_intro.html) contents.
- `working_directory` (String) Absolute directory which `ansible-navigator` is run from. Recommended to be the root Ansible [content directory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/tips_tricks/sample_setup.html#sample-directory-layout) (sometimes called the project directory), which is likely to contain `ansible.cfg`, `roles/`, etc.

### Optional

- `ansible_navigator_binary` (String) Absolute path to the `ansible-navigator` binary. By default `$PATH` is searched.
- `ansible_options` (Attributes) Ansible [playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html) run related configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ansible_options))
- `artifact_queries` (Attributes Map) Query the playbook artifact with [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/). The [playbook artifact](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.0-ea/html/ansible_navigator_creator_guide/assembly-troubleshooting-navigator_ansible-navigator#proc-review-artifact_troubleshooting-navigator) contains detailed information about every play and task, as well as the stdout from the playbook run. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--artifact_queries))
- `execution_environment` (Attributes) [Execution environment](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started_ee/index.html) related configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--execution_environment))
- `replacement_triggers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will recreate the resource. Similar to `triggers`, but will cause `id` to change. Useful when combined with `run_on_destroy`.
- `run_on_destroy` (Boolean) Run playbook on destroy. The environment variable `ANSIBLE_TF_OPERATION` is set to `destroy` during the run to allow for conditional plays, tasks, etc. Defaults to `false`.
- `ssh_private_keys` (Attributes List) SSH private keys used for authentication in addition to the [automatically mounted](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/faq/#how-do-i-use-my-ssh-keys-with-an-execution-environment) default named keys and SSH agent socket path. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ssh_private_keys))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `triggers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will run the playbook again. Serves as alternative way to trigger a run without changing the inventory or playbook.

- `command` (String) Generated `ansible-navigator` run command. Useful for troubleshooting.
- `id` (String) UUID.

<a id="nestedatt--ansible_options"></a>

- `force_handlers` (Boolean) Run handlers even if a task fails.
- `limit` (List of String) Further limit selected hosts to an additional pattern.

- `container_options` (List of String) [Extra parameters](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/settings/#container-options) passed to the container engine command.
- `environment_variables_pass` (List of String) Existing environment variables to be [passed](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/settings/#pass-environment-variable) through to and set within the execution environment.
- `environment_variables_set` (Map of String) Environment variables to be [set](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/settings/#set-environment-variable) within the execution environment. By default `ANSIBLE_TF_OPERATION` is set to the current CRUD operation (`create`, `update`, `destroy`).
- `image` (String) Name of the execution environment container [image](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/settings/#execution-environment-image). Defaults to `ghcr.io/ansible/creator-ee:v24.2.0`.
- `pull_arguments` (List of String) Additional [parameters](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/settings/#pull-arguments) that should be added to the pull command when pulling an execution environment container image from a container registry.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
